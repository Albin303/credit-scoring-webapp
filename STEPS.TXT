Phase 1: Data Collection & Initial Setup
Dataset Characteristics
Size: 1,000 customers with 55 features

Target Variable: Credit scores (continuous values 300-850)

Features: Financial data including income, debt, savings, spending patterns

Data Source: reduced_data.csv file

Initial Challenges Identified
Class Imbalance: Many credit score values had very few samples

Continuous Target: Initially treated as classification (incorrect approach)

Missing Values: Required preprocessing and feature completion



Phase 2: First Model Attempt - CNN (Failed Approach)
CNN Implementation
Architecture: 1D Convolutional Neural Network

Reasoning: Attempted to apply deep learning to tabular data

Performance: 60% accuracy (poor results)

Problems Encountered
Data Reshaping Issues: Forced tabular data into 1D format

Class Imbalance: Hundreds of sparse classes with 0-2 samples each

Wrong Problem Formulation: Treated continuous scores as discrete classes

Poor Feature Learning: CNNs not suited for tabular financial data

Key Learning: CNNs are inappropriate for structured tabular data



Phase 3: Problem Reformulation & Data Splitting


Critical Realization
Switched from Classification to Regression: Credit scores are naturally continuous

Proper Data Splitting: 80% train, 20% test (800/200 samples)

Feature Scaling: Applied StandardScaler for neural network compatibility

Data Preprocessing Pipeline
python
# Train/Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature Scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)


Phase 4: MLP Model Development & Optimization
Initial MLP Results
Basic Architecture: Simple multilayer perceptron

Performance: R² = 0.27, MAE = 39.1 points

Status: Significant improvement over CNN but still inadequate

Advanced MLP Enhancement
Enhanced Architecture:

BatchNormalization layers

Dropout regularization (0.1-0.4)

Multiple hidden layers (512→256→128→64→1)

Huber loss function

Advanced Callbacks: Early stopping, learning rate scheduling

Feature Engineering: QuantileTransformer + PolynomialFeatures

Feature Engineering Pipeline
python
# 1. Quantile Transformation (55 features → 55 normalized)
quantile_transformer = QuantileTransformer(n_quantiles=100)

# 2. Polynomial Features on top 10 correlated features  
poly_features = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, interaction_only=True)

# 3. Combine: 55 quantile + 45 polynomial = 100 enhanced features
# 4. Final scaling with StandardScaler
Final MLP Performance
R² Score: 0.5609 (56% explained variance)

MAE: 31.93 points

Improvement: 105% better than initial attempt

Status: Acceptable for business use

Phase 5: Model Interpretation & Explainability
SHAP Implementation Challenges
Feature Mismatch: Enhanced features (100) vs original names (55)

Solution: Used original data for interpretability

Business Value: Regulatory compliance and stakeholder understanding

Key Insights from Model
Feature Importance: Identified most influential financial factors

Model Transparency: Enabled explanation of individual predictions

Regulatory Readiness: Made black-box model explainable


Phase 6: Prediction Pipeline Development
Production Pipeline Creation
python
def predict_credit_score(customer_data):
    # 1. Load saved model and transformers
    # 2. Preprocess user input (3 values → 100 features)
    # 3. Apply MLP prediction
    # 4. Return formatted results
Pipeline Components
Model Loading: Trained MLP + all preprocessing transformers

Feature Processing: Same pipeline as training (quantile + polynomial)

Prediction Generation: Neural network inference

Result Formatting: User-friendly output


Phase 7: Interactive User Interface
User Input System
Interactive Prompts: Income, debt, savings collection

Input Validation: Error handling and range checking

User Experience: Clean, professional interface

Sample Interaction
text
🏦 Credit Score Calculator (Using YOUR MLP Model)
Enter your annual income (₹): 50000
Enter your total debt (₹): 1500  
Enter your total savings (₹): 25000

Result: Credit Score 730, High Approval Chance


Phase 8: Business Logic Integration
Realistic Adjustments
Your MLP model was enhanced with business rules to handle edge cases:

Debt Coverage Rule
python
if debt_coverage >= 1.0 and net_worth >= 0:
    boost = min(100, 50 + (net_worth / income * 20))
Logic: If savings can pay off all debt → bonus points

Business Rationale: Virtually risk-free customers

High Net Worth Rule
python
if net_worth_ratio > 3:
    boost = min(75, net_worth_ratio * 15)
Logic: Net worth > 3x income → wealth bonus

Business Rationale: Premium customer treatment
